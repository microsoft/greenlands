"""Main module class.

The AgentToolkit handles the connection to AzureEventHub and multiple
concurrent games.
It handles the initial Events sent and received before the Agent is
completely included in the game through the PlatformPlayerJoinsGameEvent.
The AgentToolkit created new games, keeps track of active games and their
associated GameEnvironment instances, and distributes received events to
corresponding games based on game_id. It also sends back the events generated
by each GameEnvironment to the AzureEventHub.
