class EventCallbackProvider:
    """Provides methods to call when an operation that may trigger an event has happened.

    Methods of this class should be called from the GameEnvironment or subclass when the
    game state is altered, to notify the Minecraft server of the change.

    NOTE: Not all calls to methods will cause events to be sent or published. For example, movement
    events are produced only when the distance between the last sent location and the new target
    location is sufficiently big. This significantly lowers the number of events sent.

    When sending other types of events, for example PlayerChatEvent, the position of all the
    involved players is sent first.
